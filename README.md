# blended-wing-underwater-glider-UCL

A repository containing the analyses for the design and analyses of the **UCL blended wing underwater glider**.
   


## Repository structure  
  
### 1.Glider_dynamics  

This folder contains the software developed to analyse the glider dynamics, encompassing:
- [ ] a preliminary dynamic analysis based on an analytical estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients (used for the initial vehicle design and sizing) ![INITIAL_ANALYSIS](./1.Glider_dynamics/1.1_Dynamic_analyses_based_on_XFLR5/);  
- [ ] a verification based on an estensive CFD campaign, with the nonlinear dynamics simulated in Modelica OpenMAUVe ![NONLINEAR_VERIFICATION](./1.Glider_dynamics/1.2_Modelica_dynamics/).
